This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates an out-of-bounds vector access error. The `bug.rs` file contains the buggy code, which attempts to access an element of a vector using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version of the code that avoids this error. This example highlights the importance of carefully checking array and vector indices in Rust to prevent runtime panics.
